QuickSight : 

-- Amazon QuickSight is a fully managed cloud-scale business(serverless) intelligence service that is powered by machine learning and allows you to create data visualizations and dashboards for the people you work with, wherever they are. It's a competitor to business intelligence tools like Tableau and Microsoft's Power BI.

-- Amazon QuickSight for software as a service (SaaS); QuickSight lets you easily create and publish interactive BI dashboards that include machine learning-powered insights.

QuickSight Features : 

-- pay per session pricing 

Eg : if a reader access QS for 30 minutes , u will be charged for that session only which is $0.30 , max charge is $5 per month 

-- Scales to tens of thousands of users 

-- ML insights 

-- Support for multiple platforms Android, IOS

-- EAsy Integration with AWS services and other third-party services(jira, service now, salesforce)


Working Flow 

S3 bucket which have data --> AWS lake formation ( aws glue Crawler--> glue catalog) --> Amazon Athena / Amazon EMR/AMazon Redshift Specturm --> Amazon QuickSight


Components of QuickSight :

1 SPICE :

S = Super-fast 
P = Parallel
I = In-memory
C = Calculation
E = Engine

-- automate and it is managed by AWS , once u load the data in the SPICE , u can generate as many visualizations as u want 

-- it is quite Costly 

10GB/User and $0.38/GB afterwards

Advantages :

-- fast for analytical Queries
-- more wait in Direct Queries
-- Data Stored in SPICE can be used multiple times 

Problem : What if source data got refreshed?

once u have data and nxt day u have added some data , that should be also display in visualization , in this process u have to refresh the day everytime and specify the intervals 



2 Direct Queries : (only for DB-source)

-- in this model u can genarate the visualizations instaed of loaded into the SPICE to overcome from the billing 

-- got Direct Queries , the dataSource must be a DataBase Such as RDS, Athena, DynamoDB

Advantages:

-- ONly charged when u create analysis 

-- NO need to refresh the data as we must do in SPICE


-- how to setup QuickSight account for first time users

-- go with enterprise edition 

-- choose Authentication method = Use IAM federated identities & QuickSight-managed users

-- give name of ur account   == SubbuAthena

-- give access to ur s3 bucket

--  done with registration 



===============================================Hands-On=============================================


Step 1 : create s3 bucket and insert some .csv data 

--  insert some  data in the bucket 

--   create one folder inside bucket and go to google and search for sample .csv files downlaod and upload in the s3 bucket 

Step 2 : Glue

-- open glue in console

-- glue --> left panel data Catalog --> crawlers --> add crawlers --> give name of ur crawler --> not yet --> add a data source --> choose s3 --> copy uri of ur bucket and paste in S3 path --> click on create new role , give name of ur role and select nxt --> click on create new database --> give name of ur database , nxt --> frequency = on-demand --> create crawler

-- now try to run the crawler , 

--  u can also check the logs in cloudwatch 

-- once u done with the running part , a table will added to the database , table name is same as the folder name of s3 that u have uploaded 

--  if ur data is not match , then u can also do edit ur schema 


step 3 : Athena

-- open Athena in the console

-- in the left panel u will see the database and table , u can check all the coloums of ur table

-- now do queries , before that u should add destination to store our outputs in the s3 bucket 

-- go to s3 buckets create one folder in the bucket to store the outputs

-- now try to query in athena editor

-- SELECT * FROM "weather-database"."weather_csv" limit 10;

above is eg query , u can replace with ur details 

weather-database = database name 

weather_csv = table name


NOTE : if u r getting zero records but query is successfull then do 

ur s3 location is like this 

s3://doc-example-bucket/table1.csv 

-- to get avoid from this error , jst create one sub-folder and upload .csv file in that subfolder 

s3://doc-example-bucket/table1/table1.csv



-- in the crawler location u have to give like this , then u won't get any error

s3://doc-example-bucket/table1/


Step 4 : open QuickSight 

-- create dataset --> choose athena , it is our use case now --> give name of ur dataSource --> validate connection n create dataSource --> select database --> select table of urs .

-- choose Direct query --> visualize

-- once u do this , in the left panel all the field list will visible and select any one as u want 

-- there will be sigltly delay in Direct queries
